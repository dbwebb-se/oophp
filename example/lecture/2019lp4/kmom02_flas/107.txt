   Sagt om Code refactoring
   ------------------------
   
   "By continuously improving the design of code, we make it 
   easier and easier to work with. This is in sharp contrast
   to what typically happens: little refactoring and a great
   deal of attention paid to expediently adding new features.
   If you get into the hygienic habit of refactoring
   continuously, you'll find that it is easier to extend and
   maintain code."
